# Hello. My name is Jovana.

I am studying anthropology at Hokkaido University.
I’ve graduated Japanese Language, Culture and literature course at Belgrade University.

Some of my interests are: 
- webtoons
- cow-print clothes (although I don't own any)
- food

Here’s a [link](https://www.instagram.com/m_jovana276/) to my instagram page!

>Life is what happens to you while you are making other plans.

This is a quote I've recently heard and liked.
